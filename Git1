 this is a starting of git from the 1st my commit



 my second commit from the local



this is 1st commit from th ec2

welll do face some problem due to to password and all but hte token aacces is working fine for now but i may find something for this sitty situation

now im getting a hand to this is but might need to be careful as this is getting little  tricky
i'm just this if this commit is pushed from the ec2 with password instead of token access



as i suspected the code cannot be pushed through the passwd we do need the personal access token
